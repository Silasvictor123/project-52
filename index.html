                                         <li> There are mainly two species of true camels: the Dromedary and the Bactrian. The Dromedary is found in the Middle East and is also called Arabian camel. They have a single hump on the back. The camels with two humps on their back are called Bactrian camels, and they are found in parts of central Asia.</li>

<li>There are no wild Dromedary camels as they have all been domesticated. The only species of camels found in the wild are Wild Bactrian camels. Australia has a population of feral camels that are descended from domesticated ancestors. 80% of camels in India are mostly in the desert region of Rajasthan.</li>

<li>Camels can survive in harsh environments. They can survive without food and water for long. It was believed that they store water but was later discovered to be a fat reserve. Fats are a more concentrated source of energy that allows camels to go for long periods of time without food.</li>

                            <li>The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night, so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep.</li>

                                          <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</li>
                                          <li>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.</li>
                                          <li> Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li>
